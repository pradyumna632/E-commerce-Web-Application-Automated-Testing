# Automated E-commerce Web Application Testing

This project demonstrates automated testing of an e-commerce web application using Selenium WebDriver, Java, and TestNG. The automation framework is designed to test essential functionalities across various pages of the [E-commerce web application](https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/), ensuring reliability and efficiency in the testing process.

## Features

- **Page Coverage**: Automated test cases cover crucial pages including Home, Sign In, Product Description, Jackets, and Checkout, ensuring comprehensive testing of the application.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implemented POM design pattern for maintainable and scalable test suite architecture, enhancing readability and reusability of code.
- **TestNG Annotations**: Utilized TestNG annotations such as `@Test`, `@BeforeMethod`, and `@AfterMethod` for organized test execution and setup/cleanup procedures.
- **Properties Files**: Integrated properties files for managing test data and configurations, enhancing flexibility and ease of maintenance.
- **High Reliability**: Demonstrated high reliability with a 90% test success rate, minimizing false positives and ensuring accurate testing outcomes.
- **GitHub Link**: [Link to GitHub Repository] (https://github.com/pradyumna632/Ecommerce-Web-Automation-using-POM)
